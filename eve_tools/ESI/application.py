    clientId is the primary key for each Application.
    Application has a save() function, which is useful for storing single Application.
    If multiple Application(s) need to be stored, append to ESIApplications and use its save().

    Attributes:
        clientId: str
            A str acting as a unique key for an Application, created and retrieved from ESI developer site:
            https://developers.eveonline.com/

        scope: str
            A comma seperated str, usually copied from ESI developer site,
            in the format "esi...v1 esi...v1 esi...v1"
        callbackURL: str
            A str of URL that the authentication will redirect to.
            Default and recommend using: https://localhost/callback/

    Example usage:
        >>> # 1. Navigate and log in to https://developers.eveonline.com/.
        >>> # 2. Click "Manage Applications" in the center.
        >>> # 3. Click "Create a new Application" or "View Application".
        >>> # 4. After creating an application or viewing an application,
        >>> #   copy the "Client ID", "Callback URL", and click "Copy Scopes to Clipboard".
        >>> #   Do not reveal "Secret Key" field.
        >>> clientId = {"Client ID" field copied}
        >>> scope = {Pasted content after clicking "Copy Scopes to Clipboard"}
        >>> callbackURL = {"Callback URL" field copied}
